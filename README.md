# Bank Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a bank dataset to uncover insights related to customers' demographics, financial status, and behavioral patterns.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Customer ID`
- `Name`, `Surname`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Region`
- `Job Classification`
- `Date Joined`
- `Balance`

# Project Objectives

- Understand the structure and distribution of the data.
- Segment customers based on age and balance levels.
- Identify regional and gender-based differences.
- Track customer acquisition trends over time.
- Visualize data effectively using charts and graphs.

# Data Preprocessing

- Converted `Date Joined` to datetime format.
- Created new features like `Age Group`, `Balance Level`, `Join Month`, etc.
- Handled missing data using `fillna()` and proper binning.

# Key Insights & EDA Tasks

- Gender distribution and balance comparison.
- Region-wise total and average balances (with dual-axis visualization).
- Customer segmentation based on `Age Group` and `Balance Level`.
- Top regions by average balance.
- Customer acquisition trend over months.
- Job classification vs. customer count and average balances.
- Pie charts and bar graphs to highlight major trends.
